    /*Example Problem2. Write a Selection Sort Algorithm that selects the high and low
integer from an array of integers with each pass and builds a sorted array of integers by
inserting the high and low selection with each pass. Your output should show the
original array of integers and the output of each pass on a new line.
Example Output:
Input Array: [ 42 , 24, 7, 13, 36, 52]
Pass 1: [7, 52]
Pass 2: [7, 13, 42, 52]
Pass 3: [7, 13, 24, 36, 42, 52]
Deliverable: Problem Specification
Objectives/ Requirements:
- Given an input array of integers, modify a selection sort algorithm to select both the
high and low integers of the array with each pass in order to build a sorted array.
Outputs
- a sorted array of integers derived from an original un-sorted array of integers
- the sorted results after each pass
Inputs
- a single array of integers
Assumptions
- all array values are integer
- there are more than one value in the array
Constraints
- integers only
- sort with both high and low values
Equations/Data/Previous Results
- Not applicable
