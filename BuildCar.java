/****************************************************
 * Programmer: Geneiva Ocampo
 * Course CSCI 1471
 * Date 02/9/2024
 * Assignment: Homework #3: MyCarApp
 * Environment Java with Netbeans
 * Files Included: MyCarApp & BuildCar
 * Purpose: create 2 car objects and specify requirements towards a trip
 * Input: Integers
 * Preconditions/ Assumptions: That program starts at zero
 * Equations: Speed = Speed + accelerate, Speed = Speed - decrement, 1*degrees 
Direction = Direction - degrees; if (degrees <= 0), if (degrees >= 0) 
Direction = Direction + degrees, Odometer = Odometer + miles, Fuel_gauge = Fuel_gauge + gas, Fuel_pumped = Fuel_gauge - Odometer/20;
 * Output: Speed, Fuel, Direction, Odometer, Fuel Used
 * Postconditions/Assumptions: Type of Integer Variable 
 * Contraints: 2 class objects
 * Algorithm: 
 * Prompt User to enter a Speeds
 * Prompt user to enter Miles Traveled
 * Prompt User to enter Fuel Used
 * Prompt user to enter direction used in positive degrees for right and negative degrees for left
 *
 * Output the initial Speed, Fuel, Direction, Odometer, Fuel Used at 0
 * Output the new values after user input and use equations for output
 * Output final results after adding each value together
